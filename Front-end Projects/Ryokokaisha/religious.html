            The shrine is located in the city of Nankana Sahib, near the city of
            Lahore in the Punjab province of Pakistan. This place has vital
            importance for any Sikh around the world because it is the
            birthplace of their founder Guru Nanak. It was constructed in 1600
            CE. Every year a lot of Sikhs come to Pakistan to celebrate the
            birth of their religious founder. The government had allowed around
            15 Sikhs to live there so that they can take care of daily services.
            Sikh community shows a lot of respect to Pakistan and considers this

        valuable in the world because of the shrine of its founder. The gurdwara
        forms part of an ensemble of nine important gurdwaras in Nankana Sahib.
        86 Sikhs were killed during the 20 February 1921 Nankana massacre, which
        took place after a confrontation between supporters of the gurdwara's
        manager, Mahant Narayan Das, and members of the reformist Akali
        movement.

            The Shri Katas Raj Temples also known as Qila Katas, is a complex of
            several Hindu temples connected to one another by walkways. The
            temple complex surrounds a pond named Katas which is regarded as
            sacred by Hindus. The complex is located in the Potohar Plateau
            region of Pakistan's Punjab province. The temple's pond is said in
            the Puranas to have been created from the teardrops of Shiva after
            he wandered the Earth inconsolable after the death of his wife Sati.
            The pond occupies an area of two Kanals and 15 marlas, with a

        prime minister Lal Krishna Advani in 2005. In 2006, the Pakistani
        government began restoration works at the temples, with further
        improvements announced in 2017.

            Hinglaj Mata, also known as Hinglaj Devi, Hingula Devi, and Nani
            Mandir, is a Hindu temple in Hinglaj, a town on the Makran coast in
            the Lasbela district of Balochistan, and is in the middle of the
            Hingol National Park. The shrine is in a small natural cave. There
            is a low mud altar. There is no man-made image of the goddess. A
            small divine form of Hinglaj Mata is worshipped. The stone is
            smeared with sindoor (vermilion), which possibly gives the location
            its Sanskrit name Hingula, which is the root of the present-day name
            Hinglaj.

        the Hingol River. The area is under the Hingol National Park.

            Gandhara and has been exceptionally well-preserved. The monastery

        Pakistan's Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Province. A small fortified city, dating
        from the same era, sits nearby. The first modern historical reference to
        these ruins was made in 1836 by a French officer who referred to the
        Buddhist remains in a village named Mazdoorabad.
