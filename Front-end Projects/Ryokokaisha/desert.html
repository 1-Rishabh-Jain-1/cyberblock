            The Cholistan Desert Punjabi:also locally known as Rohi is a large
            desert in the southern part of Punjab, Pakistan that forms part of
            the Greater Thar Desert which extends to Sindh province and the
            Indian state of Rajasthan. It is one of two large deserts in Punjab,
            the other being Thal Desert. The name is derived from the Turkic
            word chol, meaning "sands", and istan, a Persian suffix meaning
            "land of".Cholistan covers an area of 25,800 km2 (10,000 sq mi) in

        Punjab. The nearest major city is Bahawalpur city, 30 km (19 mi) from
        the edge of the desert. The desert stretches about 480 kilometres in
        length, with a width varying between 32 and 192 kilometres. It is
        located between 27°42΄00΄΄ to 29° 45΄00΄΄ north, and 69°57' 30'′ to 72°
        52' 30'′ east. 81% of the desert is sandy, while 19% is characterized by
        alluvial flats and small sandy dunes. The entire region is subject to
        desertification due to poor vegetation cover resulting in wind erosion.

            The Thal desert is situated at 31°10’ N and 71°30’ E in the province
            of Punjab, Pakistan. Located near the Pothohar Plateau, the area
            falls under the Indomalayan biogeographic realm and stretches for a
            length of approximately 190 miles (306 km) with a maximum breadth of
            70 miles (113 km). It is bound by the piedmont of the northern Salt
            Range, the Indus River flood plains in the west and the Jhelum and
            Chenab River floodplains in the east. The Thal desert is a
            subtropical sandy region with severe climatic conditions that are

        climatic conditions (annual rainfall less than 200mm) and the remaining
        half sees semi-arid climatic conditions (annual rainfall between 200mm
        and 500mm). The desert is also characterised by strong winds that blow
        year-round and can cause serious wind erosion that leads to local crop
